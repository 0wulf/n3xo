# N3xo

Interactive web app to visualize your personal social graph. Represent the people you've met over time as a force-directed graph, where each node is a person and each edge is the relationship between them.

Built with React, d3-force, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Interactive force-directed graph (zoom, drag, selection)
- Three view modes: color, clusters, and combined
- Filters by date, group, relation type, and text search
- Detail panel for people and connections
- Full CRUD: add, edit, and delete people and relations
- Customizable groups and relation types
- Export/import data (JSON, PNG, SVG)
- Automatic local persistence

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## PoC
This webapp is a proof of concept, but maybe some day this could be part of a fully fledged social journal for yourself. Connect it to your workspace, connect via Telegram bot, tell it about the people you have met in person and get insights automatically of the meetings you had online.
